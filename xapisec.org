   In accordance with [[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-13.pdf][OMB Memorandum M-15-13]], which mandates the exclusive use of
HTTPS with HSTS across all Federal government web services, it stands to reason
that, as a DoD initiative, [[http://www.adlnet.gov/capabilities/tla/experience-api.html][xAPI]] should hold itself, at a minimum, to this standard.

This document intends to establish a set of best practices for secure xAPI usage,
hopefully leading to a standard extending xAPI, provisionally termed xAPIsec.
